## Project title

A little Drag Up and Down Project

## Code style

I thought about doing it using OOP, but since it's just a drag up and down of the button and somedivs I though it should be a overkill. I ended up doing it as procedural programming

## Tech/framework used

No frameworks used

<b>Built with</b>

- [Vanilla Javascript]

## Features

What makes your project stand out?

## Tests

Since there were only 2 functions and it only changed the elements I decided not to test, even though I am already familiar with Jest.

## How to use?

Click on the central button on the page and drag it up or down.
The app will load on the last position the user left the button, as required. Since I did not see any feature to 'clear' the localStorage, once it;s used it will be only returned to initial position using localStorage.clear() on the console.
